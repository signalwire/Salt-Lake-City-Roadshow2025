## ⚙️ Step 1: Make a SignalWire Space  
[Sign up here](https://signalwire.com/sign-up). You’ll need this to access numbers, call flows, agents, and all the real-time magic. Get your project ID and tokens.

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent
- Vist : [Nebula Works SWML](https://github.com/signalwire/Salt-Lake-City-Roadshow2025/tree/main/Nebula%20Works%20Repairs/SWML)
- Copy and Paste the yaml script into your SignalWire Space
- Assign SWML Script to a phone number and dial the PSTN number
---

## Step 3: Implement click to call functionality
- Vist [Nebula Works html](https://github.com/signalwire/Salt-Lake-City-Roadshow2025/blob/main/Nebula%20Works%20Repairs/index.html)
- Go to Click to Call Widget on SignalWire Dashboard
- Replace Call Widget in .html file with the call widget generated from your space

## 🃏 Bonus Round: Sigmond Plays Blackjack  
Want an AI agent that’s not just functional, but dangerously fun?  
Try [`sigmond-blackjack`](https://github.com/signalwire/sigmond-blackjack) — it’s a blackjack-playing AI that talks trash and takes calls.  
Perfect if your boss says “make it interactive” and you say “say less.”

---

## 🧩 Build Your Own Agent  
Use `AgentBase` from the SDK. Throw in a `run()` and define your goal with a few prompt sections. Customize with tools or SWAIG functions. No PhD required.

---

## 🪄 Add SWML if You Want Power  
Write some YAML or JSON. Control calls. Loop callers. Summon AI. Whatever.  
SWML = telecom wizardry for humans.  
Bonus: it won't yell at you for missing a semicolon.

---
Most platforms *bolt* AI *onto* telecom. SignalWire **is** telecom + AI.  
No extra hops. No extra lag. Just vibes.

🎉 That’s it. Hack responsibly.
